# Background
I came up with this project because I wanted to try out a couple of things:

1. Streamlit
2. Implement Statistics Knowledge
3. Docker (later on in the project)
4. Work with data that is personally interesting

Points 1-3 are pretty self-explanatory. For point 4, I decided that I wanted to work with NBA data since it's quite readily available and there's a nice python package I wanted to try out `nba_api`. Perhaps as I continue this project, I will also add on some machine learning models and eventually turn this into a sort of mlops experiment. Stay tuned...
